# World_Weather_Analysis
## Purpose

- This repository aims to create a trip app that plans the route and locations with weather, hotels, and travel destinationsâ€”using google maps to displace places to travel.

## Overview

- We created a vacation map by generating a list of 1,500 random latitude and longitudes. After extracting the coordinates, we then compiled a list of the nearest major cities using the citipy framework. The map displays the current weather conditions and provides detailed descriptions of the destinations on the map.

## Results

- WeatherPy_travel_map
